  <h2>PREFACE</h2>
  <p class="blockquot"><i>Primavera: Poems, by Four Authors. Oxford: <br />
Published by B. H. Blackwell, Broad Street. <br />
MDCCCXC.</i> (Fcap 8vo, pp. 43.)</p>

<p>Such is the title of a little 'book of verses' that at the time
found favour in the eyes of a few discerning critics, and then,
apparently, was forgotten. As originally issued its dark brown
paper wrapper was adorned with a simple but effective woodcut
design by Mr. Selwyn Image, which we have reproduced on our first
half-title. Even more fortunate has been the discovery of a
signed review in the pages of the <i>Academy</i> for August 9, 1890,
by the late John Addington Symonds. As a preface nothing could be
better. And in this connexion the lines which we prefix from
Guarini are also singularly appropriate. For these songs of Youth
are still worth while; they thrill and fill us as of yesterday
with their haunting sense of vanished love, of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">'Joy, whose hand is ever at his lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bidding adieu.'<br /></span>

<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>This little book was written by four friends, three of them
under-graduates at Oxford, and all of them penetrated with the
spirit of the higher culture of our time. The poems, it is clear,
have been carefully selected; and, it is probable, have been
diligently polished. There is not one which is not remarkable for
delicacy of style and conscious aiming after excellence in art.
Whether these qualities promise well for future achievement and
development is a question open to debate. But there can be no
doubt that in <i>Primavera</i> we possess another of those tiny
verse-books like <i>Ionica</i>, or Mr. Percy Pinkerton's <i>Galeazzo</i>,
which will not lose in freshness and in perfume as the years go
by.</p>

<p>The poems have the distinction of making one wish to be
acquainted with their authors. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>Though they differ a good deal in
mental tone, perhaps also somewhat in literary merit, they
possess marked common characteristics: a restrained refinement, a
subdued reserve, a gentle melancholy; the note of the latest
Anglican &aelig;sthetic school. We find no humour, no <i>Sturm und
Drang</i>, no inequalities and incoherences of passion. Even where
it is obvious that the emotion has been intense, possibly of a
rare and peculiar strain, as in Mr. Binyon's "Testamentum Amoris"
and Mr. Phillips's "To a Lost Love," the expression of it obeys
no violence of impulse. A tender tone of regret, rather than of
acute grief, steeps these stanzas (to quote one instance)
addressed to a friend removed into the spiritual world by death.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, thou art cold! In that high sphere<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thou art a thing apart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Losing in saner happiness<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This madness of the heart.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And yet, at times, thou still shalt feel<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A passing breath, a pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disturb'd, as though a door in heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had oped and closed again.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And thou shalt shiver, while the hymns,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The solemn hymns, shall cease;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A moment half remember me;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then turn away to peace."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It would be invidious to institute critical comparisons between
the styles of these four friends and their respective merits. It
may, however, be remarked that Mr. Manmohan Ghose's work possesses
a peculiar interest on account of its really notable command of
the subtleties of English prosody and diction, combined with just
a touch of foreign feeling. The artful employment of imperfect
rhymes in "Raymond and Ida" illustrates what I mean. Occasionally,
too, Mr. Ghose produces exactly the right phrase by means of a
felicitous <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>simplicity. Notice the line which I have italicised in
the following stanza:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In the deep West the heavens grow heavenlier,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Eve after eve; and still<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The glorious stars remember to appear;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2">The roses on the hill<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Are fragrant as before;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only thy face, of all that's dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I shall see nevermore!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Take, again, these two lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Forget the shining of the stars, forget<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vernal visitation of the rose."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is but one piece of blank verse in the book. This prologue
to "Orestes," by Mr. Stephen Phillips, has strength, is firm in
outline, somewhat tardy in movement, fit for sonorous declamation.
The gravity which I have indicated as a ruling quality of all
these youthful compositions makes itself felt <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span> here in its proper
place. We might have wished, perhaps, for more of joyous accent in
the ode to "Youth," by Mr. Laurence Binyon, which dwells less on
the rapture of youth than on its sadness&mdash;the melancholy of
Theognis over youth's decay:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O bright new-comer, filled with thoughts of joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Joy to be thine amid these pleasant plains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Know'st thou not, child, what surely coming pains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Await thee, for that eager heart's annoy?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Misunderstanding, disappointment, tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wronged love, spoiled hope, mistrust and ageing fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eternal longing for one perfect friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And unavailing wishes without end?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mr. Cripps alone permits his Muse a gravely jocund note in his
"Seasons' Comfort." He, too, of the four fellow-versifiers shows
the greater aptitude for experiments, though it may perhaps be
felt that his touch is nowhere quite so sure, nor his artistic
feeling so direct as theirs.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span></p>
<p>It is difficult to lay the critic's hand lightly enough upon
poems like these, or to make it clear what particular attraction
they possess. With all the charm of rathe spring-flowers, they
suggest the possibilities of varied personality not yet
accentuated in the authors. Let us hope that the four Muses of
the four friends will not, like the primroses,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"die unmarried ere they can behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright Ph&oelig;bus in his strength,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but that we shall profit by their summer-songs, while ever
remaining grateful for their <i>Primavera</i>.</p>

<span class="i0"><span class="figleft"><img src="images/n.jpg" alt="N" width="45" height="34" /></span>o Muse will I invoke; for she is fled!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! where she sits, breathing, yet all but dead.<br />
</span>
<span class="i0">She loved the heavens of old, she thought them fair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dream'd of Gods in Tempe's golden air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For her the wind had voice, the sea its cry;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She deem'd heroic Greece could never die.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breathless was she, to think what nymphs might play<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In clear green depths, deep-shaded from the day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She thought the dim and inarticulate god<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was beautiful, nor knew she man a sod;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But hoped what seem'd might not be all untrue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And feared to look beyond the eternal blue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now the heavens are bared of dreams divine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still murmurs she, like Autumn, <i>This was mine!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">How should she face the ghastly, jarring Truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That questions all, and tramples without ruth?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still she clings to Ida of her dreams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sobs, <i>Ah! let the world be what it seems!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the shy nymph shall softly come again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world, once more, make music for her pain.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span><span class="i0">For, sitting in the dim and ghostly night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She fain would stay the strong approach of light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While later bards cleave to her, and believe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in her sorrow she can still conceive!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, let her dream; still lovely is her sigh;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, rouse her not, or she shall surely die.<br /></span>

</span>
<span class="i0">From vague delights, rapt musings, twilight hours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turns restless, seeking some great deed to do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sum his foster'd dreams; when that fresh birth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unveils the real, the throng'd and spacious Earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he awakes to those more ample skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By other aims and by new powers possess'd:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How deeply, then, his breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is fill'd with pangs of longing! how his eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drink in the enchanted prospect! Fair it lies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before him, with its plains expanding vast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peopled with visions, and enrich'd with dreams;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dim cities, ancient forests, winding streams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Places resounding in the famous past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A kingdom ready to his hand!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How like a bride Life seems to stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In welcome, and with festal robes array'd!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He feels her loveliness pervade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pierce him with inexplicable sweetness;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And, in her smiles delighting, and the fires<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his own pulses, passionate soul!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Measures his strength by his desires,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Death, and the fabled impotence of man?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already, in his marching dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men at his sun-like coming seem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As with an inspiration stirr'd, and he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To kindle with new thoughts degenerate nations,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sordid cares immersed so long;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrill'd with ethereal exultations<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a victorious expectancy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even such as swell'd the breasts of Bacchus' throng,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Upon the wondering world;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When from the storied, sacred East afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down Indian gorges clothed in green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With flower-rein'd tigers and with ivory car<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Blown on the wind, and flush'd limbs bare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lips apart, and radiant eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ears that caught the coming melodies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As wave on wave of revellers swept abroad;<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="figleft"><img src="images/m.jpg" alt="M" width="45" height="42" /></span>e in far lands did Justice call, cold queen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the dead, who after heat and haste<br />
</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;At length have leisure for her steadfast voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That gathers peace from the great deeps of hell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She call'd me, saying: 'I heard a cry by night!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go thou, and question not; within thy halls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My will awaits fulfilment. Lo, the dead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cries out before me in the under-world.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seek not to justify thyself: in me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be strong, and I will show thee wise in time;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, though my face be dark, yet unto those<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who truly follow me through storm or shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For these the veil shall fall, and they shall see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They walked with Wisdom, though they knew her not.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So sped I home; and from the under-world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forever came a wind that fill'd my sails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cold, like a spirit! and ever her still voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spoke over shoreless seas and fathomless deeps,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span><span class="i0">And in great calms, as from a colder world;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor slack'd I sail by day, nor yet when night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell on my running keel, and now would burn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all her eyes, my errand into me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So sped I on, fill'd with a voice divine:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hardly wist I whom I was to slay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My mother! but a vague, heroic dream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Possess'd me; fired to do the will of gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I lost the man in minister of Heaven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor took I note of sandbank, nor of storm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor of the ocean's thunders, when the shores<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All round had faded, leaving me alone:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I knew I could not die, till I had slain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, when I came once more upon the land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That rear'd me, all the sweetness of old days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came back on me: I stood, as from a dream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waked to a sudden, sad reality.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when, far off, I saw those ancient towers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The palaces and places of my youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I long'd to fall into my mother's arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tell a thousand tales of near escapes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lo! the nurse, that fondled me of yore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell with glad tears upon my neck, and told<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How she, and how my mother, all this while<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span><span class="i0">Had dream'd of all I was to do, and said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How dear I should be to my mother's eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her words shook me, but shook not my resolve.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For even then there came that sterner voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Echoing to what was highest in the soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, like to those who have a work on earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And put far from them lips of wife or child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gird them to the accomplishment; so I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strode in, nor saw at all mine ancient halls;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And struck my father's murderess, not my mother.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, when I had smitten, lo, the strength of gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pass'd from me, and the old, familiar halls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reel'd back on me; dim statues, that of old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holding my mother's hand I marvell'd at,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And questioned her of each. And she lies there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My mother! ay, my mother now; O hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That once I play'd with in these halls! O eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That for a moment knew me as I came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lighten'd up, and trembled into love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The next were darkened by my hand! Ah me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye will not look upon me in that world.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet thou, perchance, art happier, if thou go'st<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into some land of wind and drifting leaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sleep without a star; but as for me,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span><span class="i0">Hell hungers, and the restless Furies wait.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the dark Curse, that sits upon the towers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bow'd down her awful head, thus satisfied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I fled forth, a murderer, through the world.<br /></span>

the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
